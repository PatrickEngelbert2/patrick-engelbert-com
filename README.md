# Patrick Engelbert Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This website was created using React.js v18 and deployed using AWS. You can access the deployed version at [patrickengelbert.com](https://www.patrickengelbert.com).

## Features

- Eye-catching design
- Home page
- Portfolio
- Contact me page
- Easter Egg hunt (coming soon)
- Bio page (coming soon)
- Experience/Resume page (coming soon)

## Future Updates

I have exciting plans for future updates to the site, including the addition of an "Easter Egg" hunt. Once the user finds all the hidden Easter Eggs, they will be presented with a trophy room. I encourage users to share their success on social media and contact me with job opportunities.
